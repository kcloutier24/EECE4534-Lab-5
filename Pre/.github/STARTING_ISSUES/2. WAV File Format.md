## WAV File Format 

A wave file has a header that indicates in which format the data is stored in the file. One part of the assignment is to properly extract the header information. To begin, populate the empty ```struct wave_header``` declaration with members which correspond to the WAVE file specification. Pay attention to the field sizes in the description. To avoid confusion, use standard types found in ```stdint.h```, such as ```uint32_t``` which have the explicit size in the type name.

As a first validation, compare the size of the resulting struct (using ```sizeof()```) and the header specification.
