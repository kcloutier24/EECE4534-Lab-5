## AXI FIFO Interfacing

Communication with the FIFO will be validated during lab time. This question prepares the implementation. 

Implement the following functions. Look up the necessary register operations in the AXI FIFO manual. Document as comments the intentions of the register operations (which eases validation and understanding later). 

1. Initialize and reset the AXI FIFO 
   * Write the FIFO registers directly as described in the *Programming Sequence* section of the datasheet. Resetting will empty stale/old FIFO contents (if any).
2. ```fifo_full``` should return true if there is no more space in the TX FIFO
3. ```fifo_transmit_word``` to write audio sample into the AXI FIFO, blocking when the FIFO is full. 

*Hint* QEMU has the FIFO partially implemented. However, it does not drain the samples so it will fill up.

Commit (reference the issue in the commit message), and close the issue.
