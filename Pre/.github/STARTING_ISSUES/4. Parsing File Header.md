## Parsing File Header

Implement the ```parse_wave_header``` function, which must complete the following tasks:

* Verify that the header is a RIFF header, reject if not
* Verify that the opened file is indeed a WAVE file, reject if not
* Verify that the contents of the file are in the PCM format, reject if not
* Print information about the audio format

Call the parse function in your main (see the TODOs). Validate that you've successfully parsed the header by using the following command, which will give you meaningful information on the file:

```bash
file WAVE_FILE.wav
```

Commit (reference the issue in the commit message), and close the issue.
