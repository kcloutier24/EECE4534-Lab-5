## 7 AXI FIFO Polling Delay

The code outlined in 4.5 polls if the FIFO is full as fast as possible. However, given the constant sample rate, rapid polling is not needed. In fact, sleeping as long as possible is preferred to lower system utilization. Assume the TX FIFO can hold 1024 stereo samples. How long does it take from a full FIFO unitl only 100 samples are left when using 44.1 kHz sampling rate? Write your calculations into the issue, as well as  comments to ```fifo_transmit_word```. Implement a sleep accordingly.
