## Release 0.1 Documentation 

This lab aims to shape the 'report' portion as a project README.md 
(on the main branch). 

Rename the current `README.md` into `LabInstructions.md`. 
Create a new README.md for your report 
(and include a link to the `LabInstructions.md` in your overview text). 

Update the README.md to include: project description,
installation/make instructions, usage definition and usage examples.
Treat this stage of implementation as version 0.1 of the usermode
hardware player. Add a discussion section to the README to reflect on
any challenges and pitfalls. Add a known issues section and describe how
this version of the player impacts CPU load and reason why.
