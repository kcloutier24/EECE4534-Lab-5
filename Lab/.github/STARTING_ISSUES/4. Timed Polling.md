## Timed Polling

#2 fills the FIFO as soon as there is any vacancy. However, this is
not necessary since it takes some time until the CODEC has played the
FIFO’s contents. To increase efficiency this section illustrates timed
polling to only fill the FIFO when needed. Continue using your code from
#2, and complete the following steps:

1.  Pre-lab calculated maximum sleep period before needing to fill
    the FIFO again with a 44.1 kHz sampling rate. Apply the principle of
    the pre-lab question and compute the maximum sleep period (can also be
    referred to as polling period) for a sampling rate of 11025 *H**z*
    (sample rate of wave example).

    Insert the sleep into the code, when the FIFO is full. Validate that
    the audio still plays correctly.

2.  Now, find and download a WAVE file with a higher sampling rate of
    44100 *H**z* or 48000 *H**z*. Play this file using the delay value
    that you calculated on the previous item. What happens to the sound?
    Why does it happen?

3.  Implement automatic calculation of the delay at runtime based on the
    sampling rate defined in the WAVE file. Verify that you can play
    files with different sampling rates successfully.

Reflect in this issue on implementation challenges, design decisions 
and observations. Close the issue.
